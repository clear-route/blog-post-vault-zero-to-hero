# Intro
This is a fictional story of an app team that recently got ripped apart during a security audit for hardcoding database credentials.
This is their story of how this adopted HashiCorp Vault and switched from static hardcoded credentials to a fully dynamic scalable secrets management solution.


# The Application

# Status Quo

# Act 01: Hardcoded static Credentials - the absolute worst
# Act 02: Static Credentials from HashiCorp Vault - a little better
# Act 03: Static Credentials from HashiCorp Vault using Approle Auth - a little better
# Act 04: Static Credentials from HashiCorp Vault using Kubernetes Auth - a little better
# Act 05: Dynamic DB Credentials from HashiCorp Vault using Kubernetes Auth - the best
# Act 06: Injecting Dynamic DB Credentials during runtime from HashiCorp Vault using Kubernetes Auth - the best
